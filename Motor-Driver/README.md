# Control motor driver using Arduino UNO.
## What is Arduino UNO?
- Arduino UNO is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P. 
- It has 14 digital input/output pins (of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs), 6 analog inputs, a 16 MHz ceramic resonator, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header and a reset button. 
- It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started
