## Description: 
- The [numbers](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/f209a32253affb6f547a585649ba4fda/the_numbers.png)... what do they mean?

### Solution: 

- The challenge provided a image with some Numbers written in the format of flag. Which was encrypted using A1Z26 cipher.
- Numbering the letters so A=1, B=2, etc is one of the simplest ways of converting them to numbers. This is called the A1Z26 cipher
